# Changelog

## rOPTRAM 0.3.3 (2026-03-21)

#### New Features

``` R
* Bumps to version 0.3.3.
```

#### BUG FIXES

``` R
* A test was added to identify and remove NDVI or STR rasters
that are totally empty. This can happen, for example, in a region that is
covered by snow on some image dates. The Copernicus SCM masking will block out
all pixels, leaving the whole raster with values of NA. This case is now
accounted for, and those image dates are skipped.
```

## rOPTRAM 0.3.2 (2026-02-14)

#### New Features

``` R
* Bumps to version 0.3.2.
```

#### BUG FIXES

``` R
* The evalfunction that calculates STR now rescales raw Sentinel-2 values 
within the script, rather than after the STR function. 
* When setting `rm.hi.str` the option was applied for each input raster separately.
This allowed for a case when one raster had very high values,
those values would be included in the final VI-STR table,
even though they would be above the high STR if the cutoff was calculated
for the whole table. This is fixed, such that high STR are removed 
after merging all raster values.
```

## rOPTRAM 0.3.1 (2025-06-10)

#### New Features

``` R
* Bumps to version 0.3.1.
* Adds new option `area_cover` to set minimum coverage of the AOI by sentinel tile.
* Checks for length of image list returned by `SearchCatalog`. If no images are left, exits gracefully.
* Removed uncessary dependency on `MASS` package.
* Changes evalscripts to download indices in INT16 datatype, to save both CDSE processing units and download time.
  (Indices are scaled back to range (-1.0, 1.0) after download.)
```

## rOPTRAM 0.3.0 (2024-08-15)

#### NEW FEATURES

``` R
* Adds option to filter out clouds, cloud shadows, water, using the Sentinel-2 SCM mask layer.
* Implements check for existing STR and VI files to avoid downloading again and overwriting. 
* Adds option to save list of images from CDSE::SearchCatalog after filtering for max cloud cover.
* Adds option to set output resolution of downloaded images.
```

#### BUG FIXES

``` R
* Fixes error in optram_safe(), offered by @kiviarttu:  [github issue][https://github.com/ropensci/rOPTRAM/issues/4]
```

## rOPTRAM 0.2.0 (2024-07-02)

#### NEW FEATURES

- Implements
  [`optram_options()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rOPTRAM/reference/optram_options.md)
  function to allow setting many algorithm options that are applied
  throughout the model.
- Implements four coloring options for the VI-STR scatter plot: colors
  by point density, colors by a categorical attribute column in the aoi
  polygon, colors by image date, uniform color with contour lines of
  point density,
- Adds tileid (Sentinel-2 tiles) to downloaded images. This allows to
  save images from adjacent tiles when an AOI extends beyond a single
  tile.
- The `CDSE` function
  [`GetArchiveImage()`](https://zivankaraman.github.io/CDSE/reference/GetArchiveImage.html)
  has been deprecated. This version of `rOPTRAM` uses the new
  [`GetImage()`](https://zivankaraman.github.io/CDSE/reference/GetImage.html)
  function.
